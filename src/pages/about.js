    <h3>Howdy! I’m Michael D. Mathew</h3>

        But most people just call me Mike. I’m a developer/designer & musician based out of the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I like to make pretty things that help people. For the last two years (and counting) I have worked as a software engineer at Call-Em-All in Frisco, TX. I also help organize the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Dallas/">ReactJS Dallas software meetup</a>. I am a graduate of the (former) code school in Austin, Texas called The Iron Yard.

        As a longtime musician and music educator I worked with some terrific programs as a performer and teacher. The list is long but includes such powerhouses as Texas A&M University-Commerce, Berkner High School, North Mesquite High School, Trinity High School, Flower Mound High School, Texas Christian University, University of Texas at Arlington, and several others all over the state of Texas. On occasion I can be seen hitting drums or marimbas or timpani and sometimes even get to write music for other people and groups. Thankfully, I do get to play drums at church every weekend, so my funky beats continue to thrive.

        My most important work: husband to my lovely wife, father to my three wonderful children, and guardian for my little brother. I enjoy any good music, Apple computers and products, and the Oxford comma. By night I stay up learning everything that I don't yet know, or I am reading about how I should be sleeping more. My family and friends are awesome and a continual blessing in my life.
