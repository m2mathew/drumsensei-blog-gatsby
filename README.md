# 2018 version of drumsensei blog

Old blog site was built with Rapidweaver. Then I rewrote the entire thing is Jekyll but never shipped it. Gatsby wandered by and caught my eye, and here we are.


# Kicked off with GatsbyJS

The default Gatsby starter.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:
```sh
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

Then you can run it by:
